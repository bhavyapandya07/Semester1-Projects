🚀 Optimization Algorithms Project



This project explores classical optimization (Gradient Descent) and metaheuristic optimization algorithms (Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization) applied to two domains:

**Machine Learning (Logistic Regression)** – to optimize the regularization parameter (C) using different algorithms and compare their performance.

**Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** – a classic NP-hard problem, solved using SA, GA, and PSO to analyze speed, accuracy, and solution quality.

The project highlights how different algorithms perform on convex problems (ML models) versus non-convex problems (TSP).

📊 Key Insights



GD performs best for convex ML tasks (fast \& optimal).

SA is fastest for TSP but less accurate.

GA gives the most accurate TSP solutions but takes more time.

PSO provides a balance between speed and accuracy, making it practical for real-world logistics.
